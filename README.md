# IV - AWS VPC Setup with Boto3
This project automates the setup of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment in AWS using Python and Boto3. It includes:
- Creation of a VPC, public and private subnets
- Internet and NAT Gateway configuration
- Route tables and security groups
- EC2 instance provisioning in both subnets
## ‚úÖ Result
- Public EC2: Internet accessible
- Private EC2: Internet access via NAT Gateway
- SSH verified on Public EC2
## üßπ Cleanup
To avoid ongoing charges, make sure to delete:
- EC2 instances
- NAT Gateway
- EIP
- Subnets
- VPC
